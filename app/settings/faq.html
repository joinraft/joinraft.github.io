            <h3>Why should I use Raft?</h3>
            <p>Because Raft is the best way to share calendar with your friends and family. To get more done, avoid misunderstandings, see what your friends got planned and do more fun together. That’s why :)</p>
            <p>We believe that it is a good idea to plan things that you want to do, big and small, but traditional calendars are often so boring that they take the fun out of planning. Especially if you’re planning something fun. Raft is beautifully designed, easy to use and since you’re supposed to share some of your plans with your friends, it is also much more fun to use than any other calendar out there.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Do I have to share calendar with my friends?</h3>
            <p>No, you don’t have to share anything if you don’t want to. A calendar could be a pretty private space and few of our users share everything. But that’s the beauty of Raft. You can set sharing settings on each event. For the plans you don’t want to share - well don’t share them. For the things you want your partner or friends to know about, share and let them know.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>How does sharing calendar with my partner work?</h3>
            <p>If you have a special someone (congratulations) and you’re both using Raft you’re all set to create a partner connection. That is pretty smart and adds an extra dimension to Raft. What you share with your partner is only visible to the two of you.</p>
            <p>Sharing calendar with you partner, BFF or significant other is a well liked feature by many of our users, since it makes it much easier to plan everyday life.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Can I share events from Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook too?</h3>
            <p>Yes, if you want to you can import other calendars to Raft. You decide what calendars to show and please note that other calendars will not be made visible to any other person except yourself. Not until you manually copy an imported event to Raft can you decide if you want to share the event with your partner and/or friends.</p>
            <p>So you’re not running the risk of accidentally sharing information from another calendar to your followers on Raft, it is up to you to decide on each event if you want to share it or not.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>I’m not allowed to share my work calendar, can I still use Raft.</h3>
            <p>Sure! External calenders are never synced to Raft servers. It is only visible in your app. Sharing is never automatic in Raft, you decide, on an event basis who can see what.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>What is the difference between inviting someone and sharing an event with someone?</h3>
            <p>This is a bit tricky at first but we will try to break it down for you:<br>
            - You <i>invite</i> a person if you want them to join an event<br>
            - You <i>share</i> an event with your partner or friends if you just want them to know what you’re up to.<br></p>
            
            <p>When you invite someone they will get an invitation to the event and you can send messages to each other that are only visible to the people invited to the event.</p>
            <p>This is something that differ Raft from other calendars so it might take some time to understand. The best way is to just play around in Raft for 5 minutes and we are sure you will get the hang of it.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>What is “The Feed”</h3>
            <p>This is a unique feature in Raft, a view where you can discover what plans your friends have shared with you. Here you can like, comment and ask if you can join. This works both ways of course. What you share with your followers, is seen in their feeds.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>This sounds great! Does Raft cost anything?</h3>

            <p>Because we want people to be happier and enjoy life more. Today, too much focus is on work and making a career. It’s stressful. Our mission is to help you spend more of your time with loved ones and doing the things that makes you happy. All other things doesn't really matter that much in the long run. At least that’s what we think.</p>
            <p>So we’ve built Raft to make it easy and fun to share plans and calendars and to encourage spontaneous meetings and get togethers with your partner and friends. We hope you like Raft :)</p>
