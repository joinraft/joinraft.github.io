			<p>Why isn’t Raft syncing with other calendars?</p>
			<p>(Ok, this might not make much sense at first, but hang in there.)</p>
			<p>In the early 20th century the Russian psychologist Ivan Pavlov conducted a series of experiments involving dogs, food and saliva. In short, Pavlov realized that his dogs started drooling <b>not</b> when they were given food, but when some action made them understand that they were about to get fed. You’ve probably read about it before, it’s called classical conditioning, and it applies to us humans as well. If we for example find $20 in the street we’ll automatically look down to see if we can find some more money the next time we pass.</p>
			<p>So what’s that got to do with syncing?</p>
			<p>Today’s digital calendars were developed as office tools, and they’re filled with stuff we do at work. Meetings, deadlines and 2-dos. Some of it might be fun, but most of it is not. Digital calendars have become conditioned to negative feelings. Or as someone put it “Google Calendar is no place for dreams”.</p>
			<p>That’s why we’re not syncing with other calendars. We’ve made Raft to give you a chance to start over. A chance to create a calendar for all the fun things you’re looking forward to. A place for nurturing relations and hobbies. A calendar that might even make you smile when you see what you’ve got planned.</p>
			<p>We hope you like it. :)</p>
