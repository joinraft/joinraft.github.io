		<p>How it works</p>
		<p>1. Raft offers calendar sync in one direction. That means that events from your other calendars, like Google Calendar and iCal, will appear in Raft, but Raft events will not appear in the other calendars.</p>
		<p>2. Raft shows the same calendars as you see in Apple’s Calendar app. But this information is not visible to any other users, and not saved by Raft, unless you chose to copy the event to Raft.<p>
		<p>3. Any changes you make in the event once it has been copied to Raft will not be communicated to the original event.</p>
		<p>Why it woks like this</p>
		<p>Other calendars are fairly good for sharing events within an organization. After all that’s what they were developed to do, back in the 90’s. But if you want to share events with your friends or partner you have to set up different calendars and keep track of email-addresses and different kinds of permissions. It quickly becomes complex and hard to manage.</p>
		<p>We want to make it fun and easy to share what you’ve got planned. That meant rethinking the design and features that a modern calendar should have. We’ve put a lot of effort into this and ended up adding functionality like the feed, comments, likes, in-event-chat, pictures, and the possibility to share some events but not others (not to mention the things we’ll add in the future).</p>
		<p>However, offering this kind of functionality required us to build a new kind of calendar infrastructure. And that meant that we cannot offer 2-way sync with you other calendar.<p>
		<p>We hope you’re ok with that.<p>
