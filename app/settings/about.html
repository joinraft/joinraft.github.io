			<p>Hi, thanks for using Raft!</p>
			<p>We’re building Raft because we want to help you do more of the things you love. We can’t know exactly what that is of course, but we hope that making a calendar that is fun to use, and easy to share with your friends, is a good start.</p>
			<p>Raft is made in Stockholm in Northern Europe. We like it here. Ping us if you're in town and want to meet. And if you have any ideas on how we could improve Raft, we'd love to hear them. Send an email to <a href="mailto:anders@joinraft">anders@joinraft.com</a> or get in contact on Twitter <a href="http://www.twitter.com/joinraft">@joinraft</a></p>
