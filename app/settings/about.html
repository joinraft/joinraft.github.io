			<p>Thanks for downloading and using Raft.</p>
			<p>We believe in finding out what makes you happy, and do more of it. We believe in having fun. And sure, we can’t know what makes you smile.. but we hope that making it easy and fun to plan things with the people you care about is a good first step. That’s why we’ve created Raft. </p>
			<p>If you have any ideas on how we could improve Raft send an email to <a href="mailto:anders@joinraft">anders@joinraft.com</a> or get in contact on Twitter <a href="http://www.twitter.com/joinraft">@joinraft</a></p>
