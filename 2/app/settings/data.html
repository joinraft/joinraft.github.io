			<p>We want to make it as easy as possible for you to access Raft and see what you’ve got planned.</p>
			<p>Got an iPad? Just download Raft and connect with your Facebook account to view your plans on the iPad too. </p>
			<p>Or are you leaving on a jetplane? What you’ve added in Raft is available in flight mode. But the chat and feed won’t refresh without an internet connection. </p>
			<p>Or have you lost your iPhone? Or maybe upgrading a new one? Let’s hope for the latter. Anyhow. You’ve guessed it - download Raft and you’ll find your events, friends and chats just as you left them. </p>
